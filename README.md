# tSNE demo

This repository contains a simple demo of the 
[msvana-tsne](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msvana-tsne?activeTab=readme)
library. This library implements the tSNE dimension reduction method which can be used to
create 2D or 3D visualizations of high-dimensional data.

In the demo, we visualize a small part of the MNIST dataset in a 2D chart.
